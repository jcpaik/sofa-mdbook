> __Theorem [gauss-minkowski].__ Let $p$ be an arbitrary point on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $t \in S^1$ be an arbitrary angle. Then any convex body $K$ with the vertex $v_K^+(t) = p$ corresponds bijectively to an arbitrary (nonnegative) measure $\beta$ on $S^1$ such that $\int_{S^1} v_t \, \beta (dt) = 0$ by $\beta = \beta_K$. ^thm-gauss-minkowski

> __Theorem [supported-gauss-measure].__ The correspondence in [[#^thm-gauss-minkowski]] maps the convex bodies $K$ supported by closed $\Theta \subseteq S^1$ bijectively to arbitrary (nonnegative) measure $\beta$ on $S^1$ with support $\Theta$ such that $\int_{S^1} v_t \, \beta (dt) = 0$. ^thm-supported-gauss-measure
