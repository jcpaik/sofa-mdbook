\begin{theorem}

Let \(p\) be an arbitrary point on \(\mathbb{R}^2\) and \(t \in S^1\) be an arbitrary angle. Then any convex body \(K\) with the vertex \(v_K^+(t) = p\) corresponds bijectively to an arbitrary (nonnegative) measure \(\beta\) on \(S^1\) such that \(\int_{S^1} v_t \, \beta (dt) = 0\) by \(\beta = \beta_K\).

\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}

The correspondence in \protect\hyperlink{ux5cux5eux7bux7dthm-gauss-minkowski}{\#\^{}thm-gauss-minkowski} maps the convex bodies \(K\) supported by closed \(\Theta \subseteq S^1\) bijectively to arbitrary (nonnegative) measure \(\beta\) on \(S^1\) with support \(\Theta\) such that \(\int_{S^1} v_t \, \beta (dt) = 0\).
