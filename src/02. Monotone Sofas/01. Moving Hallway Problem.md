Instead of moving a sofa $S$ inside the fixed hallway $L$, we can fix the sofa $S$ and move/rotate the hallway $L$ by looking at the movement in perspective of the sofa. That is, the sofa is an intersection of rotating hallways. This observation has been used as the first step in many existing works.

TODO: insert figure here and add references.

We will soon consider only a finite intersection of hallways with a prescribed set of angles. With this, we introduce the following notion of an intersection of rotating hallways.

 > 
 > **Definition \[hallway-intersection\].** A connected shape $S$ is a *hallway intersection* with *rotation angle* $\omega \in \[0, \pi/2\]$ and *angle set* $\Theta \subseteq \left\[ 0, \omega \right\]$ if the followings hold.
 > 
 > * $\Theta$ is a closed set such that $\left{ 0, \omega \right} \subseteq \Theta$
 > * $S$ is contained in a translation of $H$
 > * For every $\theta \in \Theta$, $S$ is contained in a translation of $R\_\\theta(L)$, the hallway rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $\theta$.
 > * $S$ is contained in a translation of $R\_\\omega(V)$, the vertical strip rotated counterclockwise by an angle of $\omega$.

We will show that a sofa with rotation angle $\omega$ is exactly a hallway intersection with the following angle set.

 > 
 > **Definition \[full-angle-set\].** For any $\omega \in \[0, \pi/2\]$, define $$\Pi\_\\omega = \[0, \omega\] \cup \[\\pi/2, \pi/2 + \omega\] \cup {\pi + \omega, 3 \pi/2}$$ ^def-full-angle-set

# Tangent Hallway

 > 
 > **Definition \[tangent-rigid-motion\].** For any shape $S$ and an angle $t \in S^1$, define $f_S(t)$ as the  rigid motion $f_S (t) = R_t \circ T\_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}$.  ^def-tangent-rigid-motion

*Proof.* The continuity of $f_S(t)$ comes from the continuity of the support function $p_S(t)$. □

 > 
 > **Definition \[tangent-hallway\].** For any shape $S$ and an angle $t \in S^1$, define the *tangent hallway* $L_S(t) = [f_S(t)](L)$ of $S$ with angle $t$. Note that $f_S(t)$ is a proper rigid transformation so it is a map from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$.
 > Accordingly, define the *inner corner* $\mathbf{x}\_S(t) = \[f_S(t)\](0, 0)$ and *outer corner* $\mathbf{y}\_S(t) = \[f_S(t)\](1, 1)$ of the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$. ^def-tangent-hallway

 > 
 > **Lemma \[in-tangent-hallway\].** If a shape $S$ is contained in a translation of $R_t(L)$ for an angle $t$, then the tangent hallway $L_S(t)$ of $S$ with angle $t$ contains $S$ as well. ^lem-in-tangent-hallway

*Proof.* As $S$ is contained in a translation of $R_t(L)$, the set $S' = \[f_S(t)\]^{-1}(S)$ is contained in a translation of $\[f_S(t)\]^{-1}(R_t(L)) = T\_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}(L)$ and thus a translation of $L$. We will show that $S'$ is contained in $L$. This proves the goal as $S' \subseteq L$ implies the following. 
$$S = [f\_{S}(t)](S') \subseteq [f_S(t)](L)=L_S(t)$$
To show $S' \subseteq L$, we first compute $p\_{S'}(0) = 1$ and $p\_{S'}(\pi/2)=1$. For any $u \in S^1$ we have the computation
$$p\_{S}(u) = p\_{[f_S(t)](S')}(u) = p\_{T\_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}(S')}(u-t)$$
so by letting $u=t$, we have $p_S(t) = p\_{T\_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}(S')}(0)=p\_{S'}(0)+p_S(t)-1$ and by letting $u=t+\pi/2$, we have $p_S(t + \pi/2) = p\_{T\_{\left( p_S(t) - 1, p_S(t + \pi/2) - 1 \right)}(S')}(\pi/2)=p\_{S'}(\pi/2)+p_S(t + \pi/2)-1$. That is, by evaluation we have $p\_{S'}(0)=1$ and $p\_{S'}(\pi/2) = 1$.
Now we show $S' \subseteq L$. By assumption we have $S' \subseteq L + (x_0, y_0)$ for some vector $(x_0, y_0) \in \mathbb{R}^2$. By comparing their support functions at $t=0, \pi/2$ we have $1=p\_{S'}(0) \leq p\_{L+(x_0, y_0)}(0) = 1 + x\_{0}$ and $1=p\_{S'}(\pi/2) \leq p\_{L+(x_0, y_0)}(\pi/2) = 1 + y_0$ so we have $0 \leq x_0, y_0$. The set $(-\infty, x_0) \times (-\infty, y_0)$ is disjoint from $L + (x_0, y_0)$. Using $0 \leq x_0, y_0$ on the disjointness, we have that $(-\infty, 0) \times (-\infty, 0) \subseteq (-\infty, x_0) \times (-\infty, y_0)$$ is also disjoint from $L + (x_0, y_0)$. So the set $(-\infty, 0) \times (-\infty, 0)$ is disjoint from $S' \subseteq L + (x_0, y_0)$. Also, $S' \subseteq (-\infty, 1\] \times (-\infty, 1\]$ because $p\_{S'}(0)=1$ and $p\_{S'}(\pi/2) = 1$. Thus, $S' \subseteq L = (-\infty, 1\] \times (-\infty, 1\] \setminus (-\infty, 0) \times (-\infty, 0)$. □
