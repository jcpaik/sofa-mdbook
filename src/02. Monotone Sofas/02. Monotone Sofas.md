 > **Definition \[cap\].** A *cap* $K$ with *rotation angle* $\omega \in \[0, \pi/2\]$ and *angle set* $\Theta \subseteq \left\[ 0, \omega \right\]$ is a convex body such that the followings hold.
 > 
 > * $p_K(\omega) = p_K(\pi/2) = 1$ and $p_K(\pi + \omega) = p_K(3\pi/2) = 0$. Geometrically speaking, $K$ is contained in the parallelogram $P\_\\omega$ and touches all the sides of $P\_\\omega$.
 > * $K$ is supported by ([01. Convex Bodies > ^def-convex-body-supported](../A1.%20Theory%20of%20Convex%20Curves%20and%20Bodies/01.%20Convex%20Bodies.md#def-convex-body-supported)) the set $\Theta \cup (\Theta + \pi/2) \cup {\pi + \omega, 3\pi/2}$.
