TODO: Fill in the required assumptions. As of now, let's assume the followings are very true.

* The formula of $\mathcal{A}\_1$ (including their definitions, well-definedness)
  * Formula for cap requries sufficient development of [03. Area](../A1.%20Theory%20of%20Convex%20Curves%20and%20Bodies/03.%20Area.md)
  * Formula for niche requires sufficient development of [01. Green's Theorem](../A2.%20Generalized%20Green's%20Theorem/01.%20Green's%20Theorem.md)
* How to take the derivative of the formula. Also requires development of each counterpart.
