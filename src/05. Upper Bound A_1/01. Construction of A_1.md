TODO: Fill in the required assumptions. As of now, let's assume the followings are very true.
- The formula of \\(\mathcal{A}_1\\) (including their definitions, well-definedness)
- Formula for cap requries sufficient development of [05. Area](05. Area "wikilink")
- Formula for niche requires sufficient development of [01. Green's Theorem](01. Green's Theorem "wikilink")
- How to take the derivative of the formula. Also requires development of each counterpart.
