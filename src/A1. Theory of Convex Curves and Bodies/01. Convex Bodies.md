This section defines necessary tools for *convex bodies* in a plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. 

Starting Section 03, we understand any sofa $S$ with its *cap* $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$, a convex body naturally attached to the sofa. And in Section 04, we need a theory on how to understand its area to execute a calculus-of-variation strategy: which is to pertube $K$ a little bit and see how the area of $K$ (or the sofa $S$) changes. This appendix developes necessary vocabularies and theorems to execute that.

For any $t_1, t_2 \in S^1$ such that $t_2 = t_1 + \theta$ for nonzero $\theta \in (-\pi, \pi)$,
the lines $l_C(t_1)$ and $l_C(t_2)$ are not parallel so they intersect.
Let $v_C(t_1, t_2)$ be the intersection point of two lines.
\\end{definition}
\\begin{proposition}
For any $t_1, t_2 \in S^1$ such that $t_2 = t_1 + \theta$ for nonzero $\theta \in (-\pi, \pi)$, we have 
$$
v_C(t_1, t_2) = p_C(t_1) u\_{t_1} + \frac{p_C(t_2) - p_C(t_1) \cos \theta}{\sin \theta} v\_{t_1}.
$$
\\end{proposition}
\\begin{proof}
Because the point $v = v_C(t_1, t_2)$ is on the line $l_C(t_1)$,
we have $v = p_C(t_1) u\_{t_1} + \alpha v\_{t_1}$
for some constant $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$.
We use $v \cdot u_2 = p_C(t_2)$ to derive $\alpha$.
\\begin{align\*}
p_C(t_2) &= v \cdot u_2 \\
&= p_C(t_1) (u\_{t_1} \cdot u\_{t_2}) + \alpha (v\_{t_1} \cdot u\_{t_2}) \\
&= p_C(t_1) \cos \theta + \alpha \sin \theta
\\end{align\*}
This gives $\alpha = p_C(t_2) \csc \theta - p_C(t_1) \cot \theta$ and completes the proof.
\\end{proof}

\\begin{proposition}
For any point $w \in \mathbb{R}^2$ outside $C$, $w$ is equal to $v_C(t_1, t_2)$	
\\end{proposition}

Moreover, 
for any $t \in S^1$ and $0 \< \theta \< \pi$,
if we define the values
$$l_C^+(t, t+\theta) = \frac{p_C(t_2) - p_C(t_1) \cos \theta}{\sin \theta} - \partial\_+p_C(t)$$
and
$$l_C^-(t, t-\theta) = -\frac{p_C(t_2) - p_C(t_1) \cos \theta}{\sin \theta} + \partial\_-p_C(t)$$
then $l_C^+(t, t+\theta)$ is the distance between $v^+\_C(t)$ and $v_C(t, t+\theta)$,
and $l_C^-(t, t-\theta)$ is the distance
between $v^-\_C(t)$ and $v_C(t, t-\theta)$,
and the values $l_C^+(t, t+\theta)$ and 
$l_C^-(t, t-\theta)$ are monotonically increasing respect to $\theta \in (0, \pi)$.
\\end{proposition}
\\begin{proof}
We first observe that 
\\end{proof}

Most tangent lines touch $C$ at a single vertex.
\\begin{proposition}
For any planar convex body $C$, there is only a countable number of angles $t \in S^1$ with the edge $e_C(t)$ being a proper line segment.
So the tangent line $l_C(t)$ touches $C$ at the unique point $v^+\_C(t) = v^-\_C(t)$ for all but a countable number of values of $t \in S^1$.
\\end{proposition}
\\begin{proof}\[Proof sketch\]
Use the monotonicity: for any $0 \< t \< \pi$, $v_C^+(t)$ has strictly lesser $x$-coordinate than $v_C^-(t)$ unless $v_C^+(t) = v_C^-(t)$. Also for any $0 \< t \< t' \< \pi$, $v_C^-(t')$ has lesser or equal $x$-coordinate than $v_C^+(t)$.
Now if $v_C^+(t) \neq v_C^-(t)$ for uncountably many $t$'s, the $x$-coordinate of $v_C^-(\pi / 2)$ descends from the $x$-coordinate of $v_C^+(0)$ \`uncountably many times', contradicting that $C$ is bounded. 
\\end{proof}

\\begin{corollary}
\\label{cor:func}
For any planar convex body $C$, its support function $p_C$ is both left-differentiable and right-differentiable, and has only a countable number of $t \in S^1$ where the left and right differentiation do not match.

Also, if $C$ lies inside the ball of radius $R \geq 0$ centered at origin, then the functions $p_C, \partial\_+p_C, \partial\_-p_C$ are all bounded by $R$.
\\end{corollary}

\\subsection{Surface area measure}

We shall construct the \emph{surface area measure} $\beta$ of an arbitrary convex body $C$. 
Informally speaking, for any closed interval $I = \[a, b\]$ of $S^1$, $\beta(I)$ will be the length of the curve on the boundary of $C$ from $v^-(t_1)$ to $v^+(t_2)$.
In particular, the measure $\beta({t})$ of a singleton ${t}$ is the distance between $v^-(t)$ and $v^+(t)$.
Consequently, $\beta(\[a, b))$ is the distance between $v^-(a)$ and $v^-(b)$ on the boundary, and $\beta((a, b\])$ is the distance between $v^+(a)$ and $v^+(b)$ on the boundary.
The construction of such a measure is already known for $n$-dimensional convex bodies \textcolor{red}{TODO: Put citations}. 
However, as we will need show some formulas involving $\beta$ that specifically works for dimension 2, we will construct the surface area measure for dimension 2 in a different way and show later that it matches with the original definition.

Assume for a moment that $p_C$ is twice continuously differentiable.
Then for any angle $t \in S^1$ the tangent line $l_C(t)$ touches $C$ at the unique point $v_C(t) = v_C^+(t) = v_C^-(t) = p_C(t)u_t + p'\_C(t)v_t$ on the boundary of $C$.
In particular, $v_C(t)$ parametrizes the boundary points of $C$.
Note that $v'\_C(t) = (p_C(t) + p''\_C(t))v_t$,
so that the length of the curve that connects $v_C(a)$ and $v_C(b)$ on the boundary of $C$ is 
$$\int_a^b ||v'\_C(t)||dt 
= \int_a^b (p_C(t) + p''\_C(t)) dt.
= \int_a^b p_C(t) dt + p'\_C(b) - p'\_C(a)$$
Therefore, in this case, we can say that $p_C(t) + p''\_C(t)$ is the density function of the surface are measure $\beta$ we are looking for.

Now let's get back to the general setting where $C$ is an arbitrary convex body and $p_C(t)$ may not differentiable.
From the equation above, we can suspect that this will hold.
$$
\\beta((a, b\]) = \int_a^b p_C(t) dt + \partial^+\_t p_C(b) - \partial^-\_t p_C(a)
$$
We will now use this guess to actually define $\beta$.

\\begin{definition}
For an arbitrary convex body $C$,
define the function $F_C \colon \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ as 
$$
F_C(x) = \int_0^x p_C(t)dt + \partial^+\_t p_C(x) - \partial^-\_t p_C(0)
$$
so that in particular, 
$$
F_C(b) - F_C(a) = \int_a^b p_C(t)dt + \partial^+\_t p_C(b) - \partial^-\_t p_C(a)
$$
follows for arbitrary $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$.
\\end{definition}

\\begin{theorem}
For any convex body $C$, $F_C$ is monotonically increasing.
For any $a \in \mathbb{R}$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}$ so that $0 \< b - a \< \pi$,
we have $F_C(b) - F_C(a) \geq 0$.
\\end{theorem}
\\begin{proof}
Key ideas: 
First, the value is invariant under
translations of $C$.
That is, adding or subtracting multiples of $\cos t$ and $\sin t$ does not affect the value of $F_C(x)$.

Second, now we can set origin to any point that we want.
So we move $C$ and assume that $v_C(a, b)$ is the origin.
A consequence is that $p_C(t) \leq 0$ for all $t \in \[a, b\]$.
Another consequence is that $l_C^+(a) = \partial^+\_tp_C(b)$, or whatever, that it will give us a positive number as well. This concludes the proof.  
\\end{proof}

\\begin{theorem}
$F_C$ is right-continuous.	
\\end{theorem}
\\begin{proof}
\\url{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1757987/how-to-prove-that-the-right-derivative-of-a-convex-function-is-right-continuous}	
\\end{proof}

\\todo{Fill this out}
Now $F_C$ gives rise to a measure $\beta_C$ (standard real analysis result -- need to search references).
Goal: NOT to show that $\beta_C$ measures boundary perimeter directly.
We do not use that.
Instead, observe that it works linearly,
and that for the area we do have the formula that is expected.
Trapezodial region, bounded by (i) the segment connecting origin and $v_C^+(a)$, (ii) the segment connecting origin and $v_C^+(b)$, and $l_C(a)$, and $l_C(b)$.
The area of this thing will have a closed form.

\\todo{Really, all of this is only to build up the following interface that will be used in calculus of variation part. We only need to show the followings to a general reader.}

With all this, we reach the following.
\\begin{theorem}
For any cap $K$ with rotation angle $\beta$, there is a unique \emph{boundary measure} $\beta_K$ on the set $\Gamma\_\\beta = \[0, \beta\] \sqcup \[\\pi / 2, \beta + \pi / 2\]$ such that the followings hold.
$$
A^+*K(t) = p*\\beta - \int\_{s \in (t, \beta\]} v_s \beta_K(ds)
$$
$$
A^-*K(t) = p*\\beta - \int\_{s \in \[t, \beta\]} v_s \beta_K(ds)
$$
$$
C^+*K(t) = p*\\beta + \int\_{s \in \[\\pi / 2, t + \pi / 2\]} v_s \beta_K(ds)
$$
$$
C^-*K(t) = p*\\beta + \int\_{s \in \[\\pi / 2, t + \pi / 2)} v_s \beta_K(ds)
$$
\\end{theorem}

\\begin{theorem}\[Area formula using boundary measure\]
The area $|K|$ of any cap $K$ with rotation angle $\beta$ is equal to
$$
\\frac{1}{2} \int\_{t \in \Gamma\_\\beta} p_K(t) \beta_K(dt)
$$
\\end{theorem}

\\begin{theorem}\[Mixed area\]
The mixed area $V(K_1, K_2)$ of two caps $K_1, K_2$ is given as 
$$
\\frac{1}{2} \int\_{t \in \Gamma\_\\beta} p\_{K_1}(t) \beta\_{K_2}(dt)
$$
\\end{theorem}
\\begin{proof}
We only need to show that the given expression is symmetric in $K_1$ and $K_2$
by the characterization of mixed volume.
\\end{proof}

\\begin{theorem}
For any caps $K_1$ and $K_2$,
if $K = (1 - \lambda) K_1 + \lambda K_2$
for $\lambda \in \[0, 1\]$
then $K$ is also a cap and
$\beta_K = (1 - \lambda) \beta\_{K_1} + \lambda \beta\_{K_2}$.
\\end{theorem}

\\begin{theorem}
\\label{thm:variation-cap}
For any caps $K_1$ and $K_2$,
and $K = (1 - \lambda) K_1 + \lambda K_2$
for $\lambda \in \[0, 1\]$,

\\left.\frac{d}{d\lambda}\right|*{\lambda = 0} |K|

\\begin{proof}
\\begin{align\*}
\|K| & = \frac{1}{2} \int\_{t \in \Gamma\_\\beta} p_K(t) \beta_K(dt) \\
& = \frac{1}{2} \int\_{t \in \Gamma\_\\beta} ((1 - \lambda)p\_{K_1}(t) + \lambda p\_{K_2}(t)) ((1 - \lambda) \beta\_{K_1} + \lambda \beta\_{K_2})(dt) \\

\\begin{theorem}
\\label{thm:convex-curve-delta}
We can in general define a curve parametrized by its tangential angle and arc length as the following.
For any Borel measure $\beta$ on $\[a, b\]$, define its corresponding curve parametrized $\xx(s)$ by $s$
from 0 to $\beta(\[a, b\])$ as this.
Find some $t \in \[a, b\]$ so that $\beta(\[a, t)) \leq s \leq \beta(\[a, t\])$.
When the lower and upper bounds match, ...
The point is that $\Delta$ of the curve is exactly the formula we mention above.
\\end{theorem}

\\begin{theorem}
For any convex body $K$, its boundary is a rectifiable curve if we parametrize by arc length $s$.
Moreover, this parametrization $\xx(s)$ is absolutely continuous.
For each point $p$ on the boundary of $K$, we can think of $t$, the angle of tangent line that touches $p$, and $s$ which is the curve length. $s$ and $t$ are increasing \`function's of each other, where we allow the function graph to rise 90 degrees upward.
The function $s'(t)$ is exactly the surface area measure $\beta_K$.
\\end{theorem}

\\begin{definition}
For any $\xx : \[a, b\] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ absolutely continuous, define its \`triangular measure' as
$$
\\Delta(\xx) = \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b \xx(t) \times \xx'(t) dt
$$
\\end{definition}

\\begin{theorem}
For any $\xx_1 : \[a, b\] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ and $\xx_2 : \[b, c\] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ absolutely continuous and
$\xx_1(b) = \xx_2(b)$, the concatenation $\xx_1 * \xx_2 : \[a, c\] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ is well-defined 
and
$$\Delta(\xx_1 * \xx_2) = \Delta(\xx_1) + \Delta(\xx_2)$$
\\end{theorem}

\\begin{theorem}
\\label{thm:area-jordan}
If $\xx : \[a, b\] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ is a Jordan curve in counterclockwise direction (that is, $\xx$ is injective and rectifiable and continuous), the area enclosed by $\xx$ is $\Delta(\xx)$.
\\end{theorem}
\\begin{remark}
\\todo{Find the right literature}
There are a lot of generalizations of Green's theorem out there.
e.g. \``A NOTE ON GREEN'S THEOREM by B. D. CRAVEN'' or Potts.
Apostol's Mathematical Analysis: A Modern Approach To Advanced Calculus seems to contain
the proof most extensively.
The theorem above has to be the specialization of some Green's theorem.
\\end{remark}

Plans on using this: For the most general bound $\cA_1$, there are a total of 4 curves and two line segments for the area.
Use the curve injectivity + counterclockwise direction and Theorem \ref{thm:area-jordan}
to chop down into integrals of different intervals.
For convex curves, use Theorem \ref{thm:convex-curve-delta}.
For inner niche part, just use the absolutely continuous formula with the following computation.

\\begin{theorem}
\\label{thm:variation-curve}
Let $\xx = (1 - \lambda) \xx_1 + \lambda \xx_2$ be a line segment parametrization from
$\xx_1$ to $\xx_2$ where $\xx_1, \xx_2 : \[a, b\] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ are absolutely continuous functions.
Then we do the following computation. % \left. \frac{d}{d\lambda} \right|\_{\lambda = 0}
\\begin{align\*}
\\Delta(\xx) & = \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b \xx(t) \times \xx'(t) 
= \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b (\xx_1 + \lambda (\xx_2 - \xx_1)) \times (\xx'\_1 + \lambda (\xx'\_2 - \xx'\_1)) \\
& = \frac{1}{2} \lambda \left( \int_a^b (\xx_2 - \xx_1) \times \xx'\_1 + \xx_1 \times (\xx'\_2 - \xx'\_1) dt \right) + \textrm{(const/quad terms of lambda)} \\
\\end{align\*}

Do integration by parts.
\\begin{align\*}
\\int_a^b (\xx_2 - \xx_1) \times \xx'\_1 dt & = 
(\xx_2(b) - \xx_1(b)) \times \xx_1 (b) - (\xx_2(a) - \xx_1(a)) \times \xx_1(a)

* \\int_a^b (\xx'\_2 - \xx'\_1) \times \xx_1 dt \\
  & = \xx_2(b) \times \xx_1 (b) - \xx_2(a) \times \xx_1(a)

* \\int_a^b \xx_1 \times (\xx'\_2 - \xx'\_1) dt
  \\end{align\*}

So we have
\\begin{align\*}
\\left. \frac{d}{d\lambda} \right|\_{\lambda = 0} \Delta(\xx) & = 
\\frac{1}{2} \left( \int_a^b (\xx_2 - \xx_1) \times \xx'\_1 + \xx_1 \times (\xx'\_2 - \xx'\_1) dt \right) \\
& = \frac{\xx_2(a) \times \xx_1 (a) - \xx_2(b) \times \xx_1(b)}{2}

* \\int_a^b (\xx_2 - \xx_1) \times \xx'\_1 dt
  \\end{align\*}

\\end{theorem}%%
