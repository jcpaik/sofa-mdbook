 > **Theorem \[area-with-boundary-measure\].** For any convex body $K$, its area can be computed as the following. $$ |K| = \frac{1}{2} \int\_{S^1} p_S(t) , \beta(dt)$$ ^thm-area-with-boundary-measure

 > 
 > **Theorem \[variation-area\].** For two convex bodies $K_1, K_2$ and its line-segment interpolation $K = (1 - \lambda) K_1 + \lambda K_2$ for $\lambda \in \[0, 1\]$, we have the following. $$\left.\frac{d}{d\lambda}\right|*{\lambda = 0} |K|
 > = \int*{t \in S^1} (p\_{K_2}(t) - p\_{K_1}(t)) \beta\_{K_1}(dt)$$ ^thm-variation-area
