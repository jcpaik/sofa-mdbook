Here, we develop our definition of *convex curves*. Informally, a convex curve is a segment of the boundary of a planar convex body. Although there are many existing definitions of convex curves, this version is tailored to our specific needs.

 > **Definition \[measure-inverse\].** Let $\beta$ be a measure on some interval $\[a, b\]$. Let $B = \beta(\[a, b\])$. For any $s \in \[0, B\]$, define $G\_\\beta(s)$ as the unique value $t$ such that $\beta(\[a, t)) \leq s \leq \beta(\[a, t\])$. ^def-measure-inverse

* $\beta$ a measure on $\[a, b\]$
* $B = \beta(\[a, b\])$ is the total of $\beta$ 
* Informally, $t$ is the angle of the tangent line and $s$ is the arclength
  * They are bijective when the curve is $C^1$, but not in our case.
* $F\_\\beta(t) = \beta(\[a, t\])$ for $t \in \[a, b\]$
  * $F\_\\beta$ is monotonically increasing and right-continuous.
* ## $G\_\\beta(s) = \inf \left{ t | F\_{\beta}(t) \geq s \right}$

A *boundary measure* $\beta$ from $p_0$ to $p_1$ is a measure on $\[a, b\] \subseteq S^1$ such that the following holds. ^def-boundary-measure

Next: prove that the boundary of any convex body is a convex curve. This is called the 'Gauss-Minkowski Theorem'.

# Current situation

1. We need a way to talk about the area functional $I(\mathbf{x})$ on curves $\mathbf{x}$ consistently.
   1. So for example, if $\mathbf{x}$ is a join of two curves $\mathbf{x}\_1$ and $\mathbf{x}\_2$ then $I(\mathbf{x}) = I(\mathbf{x}\_1) + I(\mathbf{x}\_2)$.
   1. Also, we want the calculus of variation of $I(\mathbf{x})$ to be easy to deal with. 
1. Definition of a curve
   1. Usually a curve is parametrized by a *continuous* function.
   1. But if we parametrize a convex curve by its tangential angle, we encounter with bounded yet *non-continuous* values. Imagine a square - the 'parametrization' pops from one vertex to another discontinuously.
   1. There are two ways to resolve.
      1. Develop a new theory of rectifiable yet non-continuous curves
         1. Not using. Reasons:
            1. We can't identify a curve with the image of the parametrization
            1. Also, what is a parametrization of a square then? How long should one stay in a vertex? If more than one moment, the function is not injective! We can't use Jordan curve theorem at all here.
      1. Parametrize a convex curve by its arclength (Selected)
1. How to parametrized a convex curve by its arclength?
   1. Given a 'inverse-curvature' measure, we need to construct a *continuous* parametrization (arc-length).
   1. If smooth, s (arc-length) and t (angle) are one-to-one and calculus is rather easy
      1. Say $\beta(dt) = b(t)dt$. Then $ds=\beta(dt)=b(t)dt$. 
      1. The issue is that $\beta(dt)$ can be zero on an interval or have point mess.
