Q. convex curve -> NOT continuous. Assume a square - what would be the Mamikon for that one?

* Boundary of a convex body
  * admits a continuous parametrization
  * do we want to develop that as well?
* Mamikon's principle for convex bodies
  * using signed sum, the result will be described rather easily

Q. Do we want a non-continuous yet rectifiable curves?

* Motivation: a square is described by four vertices. A step function that jumps from one to another in counterclockwise direction might be said to describe the square, and it also has total variation equal to the perimeter of the square.
* We however ditch the idea. Most literature, including Apostol, needs continuity to *match* the curve described by $f$ with its image. With jumps allowed, we cannot use this identification and we need another means of defining the curve that the function describes.
